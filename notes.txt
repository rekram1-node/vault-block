TODO:

MVP Requirements:
- Adjust so updating requires auth
    * Password confirm should do a token exchange

Maybe Cool:
- Rust implementation of json patch if performance issues occur
- Allow user to sign out all sessions
- Allow user to export their data as pdf?
-> Data can already be pasted 1 to 1 with notion which is cool

Encryption flow should mimic bitwardens:
https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/#hashing-key-derivation-and-encryption

* New DB setup & Encryption
-> Design encryption & hashing architecture
-> DB per user?
-> Push

* Full functionality
-> JWT for vaults, autosave, etc
-> Ratelimiting
-> Max # of pages enforcement
-> Max size enforcement

* Make it pretty
-> Better Error Handling
-> Actual User Modal
-> Export your data??

* Event Driven updates??
    - may not be necessary but does help prevent data loss...
* Setup tests
* Talk about it
* Docs...
* Buy domain 
    - Also setup subdomain so dev emphemeral environments will be valid for notion integration
    - Also would need to update Vault (dev) cfg obvi
