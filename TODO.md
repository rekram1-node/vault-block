# TODOS

## Auth
- Auto logout (for password form)
- Validation should send a temp auth token or something to client,
token should only be valid for say an hour

## Protections
- Rate limiting
- Max length / size for a Vault
- Allow user to sign out of all sessions

## Best Practices
- Streaming responses and parsing when large enough?
- Refactor Drizzle code
- Better error handling
- SST infra
- Setup subdomain for staging environment
- Perf boosts with Rust based protections thing

## Bug Fixes
- Possible corruption edge case?

## Features
- Add table block
- Add image uploads
- Collaboration

## Docs / Marketing
