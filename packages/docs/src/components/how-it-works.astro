      <li>Our encryption process protects your data at every stage, from input to secure storage.</li>
      <li>We follow best practices as suggested by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP).</li>
      <li>Neither your password nor unencrypted data ever leave your machine.</li>
      <li>Even if our system was compromised, an attacker with access to your encrypted data and password hash would still be unable to decrypt any content.</li>
      <li>Our flow mirrors that of Bitwarden, using AES and Argon2 encryption and hashing algorithms.</li>
      <li>Vault Block uses secure defaults to fully comply with OWASP recommendations.</li>
